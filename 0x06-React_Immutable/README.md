# 0x06. React Immutable

Immutable objects are objects that cannot be modified after they are created. This means that every time you want to modify an immutable object, you must create a new copy of the object with the desired changes. Immutable objects are often used in concurrent programming because they are easier to manage than mutable objects.

This project introduces immutability in javascript and react using the Immutable.js library.
